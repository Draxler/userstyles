To reset your userstyles.org password, visit http://<%=DOMAIN%>/login/lost_password_done/<%=@users.first.lost_password_key%>
<% else %>
We found multiple accounts for your e-mail. You can reset the password for each of them by visiting the links below:

<% @users.each do |user| %>
- Account '<%=user.login%>': http://<%=DOMAIN%>/login/lost_password_done/<%=user.lost_password_key%>
<% end %>

If you'd like these accounts to be combined, e-mail the administrator at jason.barnabe@gmail.com.
<% end %>

If you didn't make this request or you remembered your password in the few seconds it took for this e-mail to arrive, you can ignore this notice; nothing will happen.
