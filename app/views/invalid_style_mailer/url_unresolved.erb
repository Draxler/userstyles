Hello,

You are receiving this e-mail because a style you posted to userstyles.org has been flagged as containing images or other resources that no longer load. Here is a list of your styles that have been flagged and the URLs that no longer work:

<%@styles.each do |style, urls|
%><%=style.full_pretty_url%>: <%=urls.join(', ')%>

<%end%>Please modify the styles listed above to have functional URLs. For small images, you can embed images in your style - see https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/stylish/wiki/Embedding-images-in-styles for details. If you do not fix the styles within 7 days, they will be marked as deleted and no longer appear in search results. You will still be able to fix the style at a later date and then "undelete" it.

If you have any questions, please post on the forum at http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/33462/url-reference-check-the-next-generation or e-mail jason.barnabe@gmail.com.
